                Concept of a simple menu application for a little cafe, which serves only coffee, croissants, and maybe some water, etc.
                Visitor comes to the cafe, take a seat, and order stuff via this web app, accessible through QR on any table.
                After that visitors can see their order number on a big screen near the cash desk and can grab it when it will be prepared.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The application must be implemented as a web application, which makes usage easier and more accessible. No registration is required, only ordering and online payment.
